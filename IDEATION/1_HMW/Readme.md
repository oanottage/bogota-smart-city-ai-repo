## How Might We: A Structured Approach to Problem Solving
Let's explore the "How Might We" (HMW) technique and break down its application using a real-world example. This method is often used in design thinking and problem-solving processes to tackle complex challenges. By framing problems with these simple yet powerful questions, we open up new pathways for creative solutions.

The HMW technique is about posing open-ended questions that encourage broad thinking and diverse solutions. Below, we will take you through each type of HMW question using a specific scenario: improving service quality in TransMilenio, a public transport system, while addressing financial strain and vandalism.

The Scenario:
"Improving service quality could help restore public trust and increase ridership, but TransMilenio's financial issues are exacerbated by vandalism and other operational deficits."

Let's dive into each of the 10 HMW approaches:

1. Amplify the Good
HMW: How might we build on existing efforts to improve service quality to also address vandalism and operational inefficiencies in TransMilenio?
When we amplify the good, we look for what is already working well and expand on it. In this case, TransMilenio might already have some effective service quality features or strategies in place, like reliable bus schedules or well-maintained stations. The question encourages us to enhance these strengths to also address vandalism and inefficiencies.

Example Response: By analyzing data on which parts of the service are most appreciated by users (e.g., reliable schedules, safety features), we can integrate predictive technologies, such as AI-driven maintenance and crowd management systems, to expand these successes across the entire network, helping improve service and reduce operational costs.

2. Remove the Bad
HMW: How might we eliminate inefficiencies in TransMilenio's operations that contribute to financial strain?
Removing the bad focuses on identifying and eliminating weaknesses or problems that are contributing to the issue. In this case, weâ€™re focusing on operational inefficiencies that are causing financial problems for the system.

Example Response: Using big data analytics, we could map out traffic patterns, bus delays, and maintenance failures. AI models can help identify the root causes of inefficiencies, such as poorly optimized routes or poorly maintained buses. Targeting these areas for improvement would help lower operational costs and increase system efficiency.

3. Explore the Opposite
HMW: How might we turn financial challenges into an opportunity to innovate service quality in TransMilenio?
Exploring the opposite means looking at the problem from a completely different perspective. If we are facing financial challenges, what if we could turn these limitations into opportunities for innovation instead of viewing them solely as obstacles?

Example Response: Financial constraints might limit the budget for large-scale improvements, but they could push TransMilenio to adopt more creative, low-cost solutions, like enhancing digital tools for passengers (e.g., real-time bus tracking) or using community-driven safety initiatives. These ideas could lead to higher service quality while avoiding major expenses.

4. Question an Assumption
HMW: How might we challenge the assumption that improving service quality is the only way to restore public trust and ridership?
Questioning an assumption means challenging commonly accepted ideas or beliefs that we might take for granted. For example, we assume that improving service quality is the key to attracting more passengers, but are there other factors at play?

Example Response: Instead of focusing solely on service quality improvements, we could explore community-building strategies, such as involving passengers in decision-making or creating reward programs for riders. These initiatives could build trust and attract more riders, even without a direct focus on service quality alone.

5. Go After Adjectives
HMW: How might we make TransMilenio "efficient" and "cost-effective" without sacrificing service quality?
When we go after adjectives, we focus on defining key qualities or characteristics of the service or problem we want to improve. These adjectives often describe the desired outcome, such as efficiency, reliability, or comfort.

Example Response: AI can help us identify specific aspects of service delivery that affect efficiency and cost-effectiveness, such as bus routes with high maintenance costs or stations with frequent service interruptions. By fine-tuning these operations, we can reduce costs and improve service without compromising overall quality.

6. Identify Unexpected Resources
HMW: How might we use corporate partnerships or sponsorships to reduce the financial strain on TransMilenio?
Identifying unexpected resources involves thinking about alternative sources of support that might not be immediately obvious. These could be resources like partnerships, technologies, or community involvement.

Example Response: We could explore partnerships with local businesses or tech companies that are willing to sponsor improvements in TransMilenio in exchange for visibility or advertising. These external resources could help alleviate some of the financial strain without relying solely on public funds.

7. Create an Analogy from Need or Context
HMW: How might we think of TransMilenio as a "business" that needs to balance customer satisfaction with financial sustainability?
Using analogies helps to reframe the problem in a completely different context to inspire new ideas. By comparing TransMilenio to a business, we can explore how principles of balancing service quality and profitability might apply to a public transportation system.

Example Response: Like a business, TransMilenio needs to manage customer satisfaction, maintain high standards, and ensure profitability. AI could help track performance metrics that show the relationship between customer satisfaction and financial health. By focusing on this balance, we could propose solutions that increase both ridership and system profitability.

8. Play Against the Challenge
HMW: How might we use the financial deficits in TransMilenio as an opportunity to identify and eliminate wasteful spending?
Playing against the challenge involves using the challenges you face as a way to push boundaries and innovate. In this case, we would look at financial deficits as an opportunity to identify inefficiencies and reduce waste.

Example Response: AI-powered data analysis could uncover wasteful spending in areas like energy consumption, maintenance, or unnecessary routes. By addressing these inefficiencies, TransMilenio could not only balance its budget but also improve service quality, using savings to fund improvements.

9. Change a Status Quo
HMW: How might we shift the focus from merely addressing financial deficits to proactively improving service quality as a revenue-generating strategy?
Changing the status quo means challenging the existing ways of thinking and doing things. Instead of accepting that financial deficits are just a cost, we could shift the mindset to view service quality as a way to generate revenue.

Example Response: Instead of seeing financial deficits as a permanent issue, we could use improved service quality (e.g., shorter waiting times, cleaner stations) to attract more passengers, which would increase ticket sales and reduce the need for additional funding. This proactive approach could transform the financial situation.

10. Break PoV into Pieces
HMW: How might we separate the financial issues from the operational inefficiencies and address them independently?
Breaking a problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces helps you focus on specific areas and find targeted solutions. In this case, we are looking at financial issues and operational inefficiencies as separate challenges that can be tackled individually.

Example Response: By analyzing financial issues and operational inefficiencies separately, AI can help identify precise areas where cost savings can be achieved, such as optimizing staff schedules or eliminating unnecessary operational expenses. Meanwhile, targeted improvements in service quality could address customer satisfaction independently, helping to boost ridership.

Conclusion
The How Might We method is a powerful tool for problem-solving, enabling creative and diverse solutions to complex challenges. By asking the right questions, we can explore different perspectives and develop strategies that address both immediate problems and long-term goals. Whether you're tackling a financial crisis, enhancing service quality, or improving operational efficiency, these questions can guide you toward innovative and practical solutions.

By applying these 10 HMW questions to the TransMilenio case, we not only address the core issues but also explore new pathways for growth, efficiency, and public trust.
