## **Project Name: TransMilenio Usage & Behavior Transformation (TMUBT)**

### **Introduction:**
The **TransMilenio Usage & Behavior Transformation (TMUBT)** project aims to address the challenges faced by Bogotá’s TransMilenio system, particularly concerning safety concerns and low ridership during peak hours. This initiative will leverage AI-driven technologies to improve security, real-time crowd management, and user experience, while integrating an incentive system to encourage more citizens to choose public transportation over private vehicles. The ultimate goal is to shift public behavior, making TransMilenio the primary choice for commuters and reducing reliance on private cars, thus alleviating congestion and contributing to Bogotá’s sustainability efforts.

### **Target Audience:**
- **Commuters:** Individuals who regularly use or would consider using TransMilenio, especially those who prefer private vehicles due to safety concerns.
- **TransMilenio Operators & Staff:** Those responsible for managing and improving the overall operation of the system.
- **City Authorities & Policymakers:** Stakeholders involved in urban transport planning and development.
- **Technology Providers:** Companies developing AI solutions for real-time crowd management, predictive safety analytics, and incentive systems.

### **Project Scope:**
- **AI-Driven Real-Time Safety and Crowd Management:** Implement AI technologies to optimize crowd distribution, predict overcrowding, and provide real-time alerts about crowd conditions. This includes enhanced safety measures such as real-time crime prevention updates and predictive safety patterns.
- **Incentive Program for Peak Hours:** Develop a rewards system that offers discounts, loyalty points, or other incentives for using TransMilenio during peak hours, encouraging people to switch from private vehicles to public transport.
- **Personalized Travel Suggestions:** Using AI to analyze commuting patterns, passengers will receive personalized travel suggestions to optimize their commute and avoid the busiest times and areas.
- **VIP Sections & Comfort Enhancements:** Designating sections in the buses for vulnerable groups (e.g., the elderly, pregnant women) and improving stations with smart features to enhance passenger comfort and safety.

### **Decision Matrix Assessment:**

#### **X-Axis (Feasibility): +6**
- The feasibility score of +6 reflects that while the technological and behavioral aspects of the project are possible to implement, they may present some challenges. Implementing AI-driven real-time crowd management and predictive safety measures requires significant investment in technology, partnerships with tech providers, and integration with existing systems. Additionally, the infrastructure upgrades, such as creating VIP sections and enhancing station features, may require a considerable amount of resources and time.
- However, the project is achievable, particularly if phased, starting with small-scale AI-powered interventions and scaling up over time. The incentive program and personalized suggestions are feasible and can be implemented with relatively low cost and complexity.

#### **Y-Axis (Value to the User/Citizens): +8**
- **Increased Safety Perception:** By addressing both security and crowding concerns, the project will improve the overall safety perception of TransMilenio, encouraging more citizens to use it. AI-driven safety measures and crowd management will significantly reduce the discomfort and risks passengers currently associate with public transport.
- **Comfort & Convenience:** VIP sections and personalized travel suggestions will cater to passengers’ comfort needs, creating a more appealing travel experience compared to private vehicles.
- **Incentives for Using TransMilenio:** Rewarding users for choosing public transportation, particularly during peak hours, is an effective way to encourage behavior change. It provides immediate benefits for passengers and promotes a shift in public transport habits.
- **Sustainability & Traffic Reduction:** The project will help reduce reliance on private cars, decreasing traffic congestion and the environmental impact associated with high car usage.

### **Conclusion:**
The **TransMilenio Usage & Behavior Transformation (TMUBT)** project is in the **"GOOD TO GO"** quadrant of the decision matrix. With a feasibility score of +6, the project is achievable, though it will require significant investment and infrastructure changes. The value to citizens is high at +8, as it directly addresses safety concerns and encourages a shift in behavior toward more sustainable and safe public transportation. This project has the potential to transform TransMilenio into a more appealing and secure option for commuters, making it the go-to choice over private vehicles.
