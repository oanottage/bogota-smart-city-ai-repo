### **Project Name: TransMilenio Predictive Safety & Optimization System (TMPSOS)**
THIS PROJECT CAN BE COMBINED WITH TransMilenio Efficiency & Safety Enhancement (TMESE)

### **Introduction:**
The **TransMilenio Predictive Safety & Optimization System (TMPSOS)** project aims to harness AI and data analytics to proactively address the safety and efficiency challenges in Bogotá's TransMilenio system. By analyzing external data from successful transportation systems and incorporating predictive safety analytics, the project will identify high-risk areas and times, allowing for targeted interventions to improve safety, crowd management, and overall service reliability. The project will focus on preemptively addressing incidents, improving passenger experience, and helping to shift commuter behavior towards more sustainable and secure public transportation.

### **Target Audience:**
- **TransMilenio Passengers:** Individuals who currently use or might consider using TransMilenio but are deterred by safety and overcrowding concerns.
- **City Transport Authorities & Operators:** Responsible for overseeing the transit system and implementing improvements.
- **Security Personnel & Police:** Key stakeholders involved in maintaining safety across the system.
- **Technology Providers:** Companies specializing in AI, data analytics, and predictive systems.

### **Project Scope:**
- **Predictive Safety Analytics:** AI-driven tools will analyze historical incident data, identify risk patterns, and forecast potential safety issues, allowing for proactive safety measures such as additional security or adjusted scheduling at specific times and locations.
- **Enhanced Data Collection:** Integrate external data sources (e.g., weather, traffic, and social media trends) with internal TransMilenio data to gain a holistic view of the factors contributing to safety concerns, improving decision-making for interventions.
- **Real-Time Predictive Maintenance:** AI models will predict when and where maintenance is needed, reducing breakdowns and enhancing system reliability, thereby improving passenger safety.
- **Targeted Safety Interventions:** Based on predictive analysis, security resources (e.g., patrols, cameras) will be optimized for high-risk areas and times to mitigate potential incidents before they occur.

### **Decision Matrix Assessment:**

**X-Axis (Feasibility): +7**  
- The project is technically feasible, as it involves leveraging existing AI technologies and integrating data from multiple sources. However, challenges may arise in obtaining high-quality external data, aligning with local policies, and integrating these systems with existing TransMilenio infrastructure.  
- While the investment required for predictive analytics and AI tools might be substantial, the project could be phased to ensure manageable costs, starting with small-scale pilot implementations. Collaboration with local authorities and private partners may help streamline resources and reduce the financial burden.

**Y-Axis (Value to the User/Citizens): +8**  
- **Increased Safety & Comfort:** By proactively addressing potential safety issues and reducing overcrowding, passengers will experience a more secure and comfortable commute. Predictive analytics will also enable more responsive security measures, directly addressing citizens' primary concerns about safety.  
- **Improved Efficiency & Reliability:** AI-driven scheduling, predictive maintenance, and crowd management will reduce delays and optimize bus availability, improving the overall efficiency of the system.  
- **Behavioral Shift:** A safer, more reliable system with better management of crowding will encourage more commuters to choose TransMilenio over private vehicles, contributing to reduced traffic congestion and environmental benefits.  
- **Environmental & Traffic Benefits:** By improving public transportation, the project helps reduce reliance on private vehicles, which will ease congestion, lower emissions, and make the transportation system more sustainable.

### **Conclusion:**
This project fits into the **"GOOD TO GO"** quadrant of the decision matrix, with a feasibility score of +7 and a value to citizens score of +8. The AI-driven predictive safety and optimization features are highly feasible and, if successfully implemented, would greatly enhance the security, reliability, and attractiveness of TransMilenio. By addressing key safety and efficiency issues, this project has the potential to significantly increase public trust in public transportation, shift commuter habits away from private vehicles, and contribute to Bogotá’s sustainability goals.
