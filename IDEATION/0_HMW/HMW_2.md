# How Might We: TransMilenio Safety Challenges

## Point of View 2: 
"The lack of perceived safety in the TransMilenio, especially during peak hours, drives citizens to prefer private vehicles, further contributing to Bogotá's transportation challenges."
<b>Claim:</b> Citizens feel unsafe using TransMilenio, with overcrowding and security concerns deterring use (LINK 4-5 and Claim 5).
<b>Documents:</b> "Ciudad de Bolívar" and "Cartilla Encuesta de Movilidad 2023" discuss how security concerns, particularly during peak hours, contribute to the preference for private vehicles over public transportation, impacting Bogotá's goal of reducing congestion.

1. Amplify the Good

✅ HMW: How might we enhance the experience of passengers during peak hours, so they feel safer and more comfortable?
Answer: Using data from customer feedback and congestion patterns, AI could model how improvements like better crowd management, increased service frequency, or redesigned layouts can help reduce discomfort and increase safety perception during peak hours.

2. Remove the Bad

✅ HMW: How might we decrease the perceived lack of safety by addressing concerns around crime in the TransMilenio system?
Answer: Data analysis of crime hotspots, combined with predictive AI, could assist in deploying targeted security measures such as increased patrols or surveillance during high-risk times, helping to reduce the likelihood of incidents that contribute to safety concerns.

3. Explore the Opposite

✅ HMW: How might we encourage more people to use TransMilenio despite safety concerns by making it feel like an even more secure option than private vehicles?
Answer: By integrating AI-driven features such as real-time crime prevention alerts, predictive safety patterns, and secure transport options, we can build a service that’s perceived as safer than private vehicles. Additionally, offering incentives or rewards for using TransMilenio during peak hours could shift behavior away from private car usage.

4. Question an Assumption

✅ HMW: How might we question the assumption that private vehicles are inherently safer than public transport during peak hours?
Answer: By analyzing external data on traffic accidents and congestion, we could compare the safety risks of private vehicles versus public transport. AI could model scenarios to prove that, in fact, public transport can be safer in terms of both accident rates and crime prevention, especially if improvements are made.

5. Go After Adjectives

✅ HMW: How might we make TransMilenio feel “efficient” and “responsive” in managing overcrowding during peak times?
Answer: Using real-time data and predictive analytics, AI could help optimize the allocation of buses, adjust schedules dynamically based on traffic, and inform passengers in real time of the best travel options, creating a feeling of responsiveness and efficiency.

6. Identify Unexpected Resources

✅ HMW: How might we use data from other cities with successful public transportation systems to improve safety and convenience in TransMilenio?
Answer: By analyzing the open data of other cities with similar public transportation challenges, AI can provide insights into successful strategies, such as advanced crowd management, real-time transit info, or enhanced security measures, that could be adapted for Bogotá.

7. Create an Analogy from Need or Context

✅ HMW: How might we think of TransMilenio as a “community garden” where safety is cultivated collectively, not just enforced?
Answer: Just as a garden requires continuous nurturing, TransMilenio can be viewed as a shared space that thrives on communal care. AI could suggest ways to increase passenger involvement, whether through reporting safety concerns or participating in community-driven initiatives to maintain a sense of security.

8. Play Against the Challenge

✅ HMW: How might we encourage private vehicle owners to choose TransMilenio without the perception of safety issues being a deterrent?
Answer: By analyzing how private vehicle owners plan their trips and integrating features like on-demand services, improved security measures, and personalized travel suggestions, we can turn the challenge of safety into a unique selling point for private vehicle owners to switch to public transport.

9. Change a Status Quo

✅ HMW: How might we shift the perception of TransMilenio from a secondary option to the primary choice for commuting?
Answer: By improving real-time crowd management with AI, introducing incentives during peak hours (e.g., discounts or rewards for using TransMilenio), and enhancing safety, we could change how citizens view public transport as a primary, reliable choice rather than a fallback.

10. Break PoV into Pieces

✅ HMW: How might we break down the point of view about safety concerns during peak hours into specific times, locations, and risk factors?
Answer: AI can analyze patterns to identify high-risk times and areas, allowing for targeted solutions such as adjusted scheduling, additional security during vulnerable times, and crowd control measures at specific stations.
