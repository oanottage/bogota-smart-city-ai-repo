# SCAMPER: TransMilenio Safety Challenges

## Point of View 2: 
"The lack of perceived safety in the TransMilenio, especially during peak hours, drives citizens to prefer private vehicles, further contributing to Bogotá's transportation challenges."
<b>Claim:</b> Citizens feel unsafe using TransMilenio, with overcrowding and security concerns deterring use (LINK 4-5 and Claim 5).
<b>Documents:</b> "Ciudad de Bolívar" and "Cartilla Encuesta de Movilidad 2023" discuss how security concerns, particularly during peak hours, contribute to the preference for private vehicles over public transportation, impacting Bogotá's goal of reducing congestion.

1. S - Substitute
Substitution involves replacing one element with another to improve functionality or outcomes.

Substitute Static Timetables with Dynamic, Data-Driven Scheduling
Example: Instead of relying on fixed schedules that often lead to overcrowding, use real-time traffic and ridership data to dynamically adjust bus frequency during peak hours. AI models can predict passenger surges and automatically adjust schedules, reducing the discomfort that contributes to safety concerns.

2. C - Combine
Combination focuses on merging two or more elements to create a synergy that improves the overall system.

Combine Predictive Maintenance with Passenger Flow Analysis
Example: Use AI to combine predictive maintenance data (available from open sources or previous studies) with passenger flow analytics to identify vulnerable points in the network where overcrowding and wear-and-tear may lead to safety issues.

3. A - Adapt
Adapting means taking ideas or technologies from other domains and applying them to the current challenge.

Adapt Smart City Solutions from Other Global Transport Systems
Example: Study and adapt proven safety and congestion management strategies from cities like Singapore or London. This could involve using external datasets and AI algorithms to simulate similar interventions in Bogotá’s TransMilenio.

4. M - Modify
Modification involves changing parts of the current system to improve its effectiveness or usability.

Modify Data Collection Techniques
Example: Enhance existing data collection methods by incorporating additional external data sources (e.g., weather, event schedules, local crime statistics) to provide a more holistic view of the factors affecting safety during peak hours.

5. P - Put to Another Use
This approach involves reusing existing tools or data in innovative ways to solve the current problem.

Put Social Media Sentiment Analysis to Another Use
Example: Use the same social media sentiment analysis tools to gauge public perception of safety in real time, then feed this data into an AI system that adjusts resource allocation dynamically (e.g., increasing security presence when negative sentiment spikes).

6. E - Eliminate
Elimination involves removing unnecessary or problematic components that detract from system performance.

Eliminate Redundant Data Sources
Example: Use AI to analyze the quality and relevance of various open data sources related to security and crowd density. Eliminate redundant or low-quality data streams to streamline analytics and focus on actionable insights.

7. R - Reverse
Reversal involves looking at the problem from a completely different angle, sometimes even flipping the current assumptions.

Reverse the Conventional Monitoring Approach
Example: Rather than monitoring only high-risk areas, use AI to map and continuously evaluate low-risk areas to understand what makes them safer. Reverse-engineering these conditions can help improve security in higher-risk zones.
