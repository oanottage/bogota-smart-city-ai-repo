# CLUSTER: TransMilenio Safety Challenges

## Point of View 2: 
"The lack of perceived safety in the TransMilenio, especially during peak hours, drives citizens to prefer private vehicles, further contributing to Bogotá's transportation challenges."
<b>Claim:</b> Citizens feel unsafe using TransMilenio, with overcrowding and security concerns deterring use (LINK 4-5 and Claim 5).
<b>Documents:</b> "Ciudad de Bolívar" and "Cartilla Encuesta de Movilidad 2023" discuss how security concerns, particularly during peak hours, contribute to the preference for private vehicles over public transportation, impacting Bogotá's goal of reducing congestion.

## Cluster 2: Crime & Security Measures

**Focus:** Tackle perceived and actual security concerns, targeting crime hotspots, and deploying advanced surveillance.

### From **How Might We (HMW)**

1. **HMW #2 (Remove the Bad)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we decrease the perceived lack of safety by addressing concerns around crime in the TransMilenio system?  
   Answer: Data analysis of crime hotspots, combined with predictive AI, could assist in deploying targeted security measures such as increased patrols or surveillance during high-risk times, helping to reduce the likelihood of incidents that contribute to safety concerns.”**

### From **SCAMPER**

1. **SCAMPER #7 (R – Reverse)**  
   > **“Reverse the Conventional Monitoring Approach  
   Example: Rather than monitoring only high-risk areas, use AI to map and continuously evaluate low-risk areas to understand what makes them safer. Reverse-engineering these conditions can help improve security in higher-risk zones.”**

### From **Lotus Flower**

- **Sub-Theme #2: Smart Surveillance Systems**  
  > **“Enhancing surveillance through advanced technology increases the perceived and actual security of the system.  
  - AI video analytics  
  - Facial recognition integration  
  - Automated threat detection  
  - Infrared motion sensors  
  - Behavior anomaly detection  
  - Crowd density monitoring  
  - 360-degree camera network  
  - Cloud-based storage”**

- **Sub-Theme #3: Real-Time Incident Alerts**  
  > **“Immediate reporting and response are critical to manage and mitigate security incidents effectively.  
  - Instant mobile notifications  
  - Automated alert dispatch  
  - Geo-tagged incident mapping  
  - Push notification integration  
  - Rapid response triggers  
  - Emergency communication channels  
  - Live situation dashboards  
  - User-report integration”**
