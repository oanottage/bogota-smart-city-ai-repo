# CLUSTER: TransMilenio Safety Challenges

## Point of View 2: 
"The lack of perceived safety in the TransMilenio, especially during peak hours, drives citizens to prefer private vehicles, further contributing to Bogotá's transportation challenges."
<b>Claim:</b> Citizens feel unsafe using TransMilenio, with overcrowding and security concerns deterring use (LINK 4-5 and Claim 5).
<b>Documents:</b> "Ciudad de Bolívar" and "Cartilla Encuesta de Movilidad 2023" discuss how security concerns, particularly during peak hours, contribute to the preference for private vehicles over public transportation, impacting Bogotá's goal of reducing congestion.

## Cluster 1: Overcrowding & Capacity Management

**Focus:** Address physical crowding, optimize bus frequency, and enhance passenger comfort during peak hours.

### From **How Might We (HMW)**

1. **HMW #1 (Amplify the Good)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we enhance the experience of passengers during peak hours, so they feel safer and more comfortable?  
   Answer: Using data from customer feedback and congestion patterns, AI could model how improvements like better crowd management, increased service frequency, or redesigned layouts can help reduce discomfort and increase safety perception during peak hours.”**

2. **HMW #5 (Go After Adjectives)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we make TransMilenio feel ‘efficient’ and ‘responsive’ in managing overcrowding during peak times?  
   Answer: Using real-time data and predictive analytics, AI could help optimize the allocation of buses, adjust schedules dynamically based on traffic, and inform passengers in real time of the best travel options, creating a feeling of responsiveness and efficiency.”**

### From **SCAMPER**

1. **SCAMPER #1 (S – Substitute)**  
   > **“Substitute Static Timetables with Dynamic, Data-Driven Scheduling  
   Example: Instead of relying on fixed schedules that often lead to overcrowding, use real-time traffic and ridership data to dynamically adjust bus frequency during peak hours. AI models can predict passenger surges and automatically adjust schedules, reducing the discomfort that contributes to safety concerns.”**

2. **SCAMPER #2 (C – Combine)**  
   > **“Combine Predictive Maintenance with Passenger Flow Analysis  
   Example: Use AI to combine predictive maintenance data (available from open sources or previous studies) with passenger flow analytics to identify vulnerable points in the network where overcrowding and wear-and-tear may lead to safety issues.”**

### From **Lotus Flower**

- **Sub-Theme #1: Overcrowding Mitigation**  
  > **“Addressing overcrowding is essential because crowded conditions not only decrease comfort but also increase the risk of incidents, further eroding public trust.  
  - Real-time occupancy tracking  
  - Smart crowd flow analysis  
  - Dynamic platform management  
  - Passenger distribution modeling  
  - Adaptive scheduling algorithms  
  - Predictive congestion alerts  
  - Load balancing strategies  
  - Virtual queue management”**
