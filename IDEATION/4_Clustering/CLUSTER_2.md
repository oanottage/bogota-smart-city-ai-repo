# CLUSTER: TransMilenio Safety Challenges

## Point of View 2: 
"The lack of perceived safety in the TransMilenio, especially during peak hours, drives citizens to prefer private vehicles, further contributing to Bogotá's transportation challenges."
<b>Claim:</b> Citizens feel unsafe using TransMilenio, with overcrowding and security concerns deterring use (LINK 4-5 and Claim 5).
<b>Documents:</b> "Ciudad de Bolívar" and "Cartilla Encuesta de Movilidad 2023" discuss how security concerns, particularly during peak hours, contribute to the preference for private vehicles over public transportation, impacting Bogotá's goal of reducing congestion.

# Clustering Ideas for TransMilenio Safety Challenges

Clustering is the process of **grouping** ideas or concepts together based on their shared characteristics or complementary nature. In ideation, clustering is particularly helpful because it allows us to:

- **Identify common themes** across multiple brainstorming methods (e.g., *How Might We*, *SCAMPER*, and *Lotus Flower*).  
- **Combine similar or compatible ideas** into cohesive strategies.  
- **Clarify focus areas**, making it easier to see which initiatives can be pursued in tandem.  
- **Prioritize more effectively**, since clusters illuminate where the most critical issues lie.

By clustering every idea generated from the three methods, we ensure that no concept exists in isolation. Instead, each is reinforced or enriched by others, contributing to a more **integrated approach** for enhancing safety and perception of TransMilenio.

**Focus:** Address physical crowding, optimize bus frequency, and enhance passenger comfort during peak hours.

### From **How Might We (HMW)**

1. **HMW #1 (Amplify the Good)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we enhance the experience of passengers during peak hours, so they feel safer and more comfortable?  
   Answer: Using data from customer feedback and congestion patterns, AI could model how improvements like better crowd management, increased service frequency, or redesigned layouts can help reduce discomfort and increase safety perception during peak hours.”**

2. **HMW #5 (Go After Adjectives)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we make TransMilenio feel ‘efficient’ and ‘responsive’ in managing overcrowding during peak times?  
   Answer: Using real-time data and predictive analytics, AI could help optimize the allocation of buses, adjust schedules dynamically based on traffic, and inform passengers in real time of the best travel options, creating a feeling of responsiveness and efficiency.”**

### From **SCAMPER**

1. **SCAMPER #1 (S – Substitute)**  
   > **“Substitute Static Timetables with Dynamic, Data-Driven Scheduling  
   Example: Instead of relying on fixed schedules that often lead to overcrowding, use real-time traffic and ridership data to dynamically adjust bus frequency during peak hours. AI models can predict passenger surges and automatically adjust schedules, reducing the discomfort that contributes to safety concerns.”**

2. **SCAMPER #2 (C – Combine)**  
   > **“Combine Predictive Maintenance with Passenger Flow Analysis  
   Example: Use AI to combine predictive maintenance data (available from open sources or previous studies) with passenger flow analytics to identify vulnerable points in the network where overcrowding and wear-and-tear may lead to safety issues.”**

### From **Lotus Flower**

- **Sub-Theme #1: Overcrowding Mitigation**
