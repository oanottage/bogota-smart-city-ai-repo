# CLUSTER: TransMilenio Safety Challenges

## Point of View 2: 
"The lack of perceived safety in the TransMilenio, especially during peak hours, drives citizens to prefer private vehicles, further contributing to Bogotá's transportation challenges."
<b>Claim:</b> Citizens feel unsafe using TransMilenio, with overcrowding and security concerns deterring use (LINK 4-5 and Claim 5).
<b>Documents:</b> "Ciudad de Bolívar" and "Cartilla Encuesta de Movilidad 2023" discuss how security concerns, particularly during peak hours, contribute to the preference for private vehicles over public transportation, impacting Bogotá's goal of reducing congestion.

### From **How Might We (HMW)**

1. **HMW #3 (Explore the Opposite)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we encourage more people to use TransMilenio despite safety concerns by making it feel like an even more secure option than private vehicles?  
   Answer: By integrating AI-driven features such as real-time crime prevention alerts, predictive safety patterns, and secure transport options, we can build a service that’s perceived as safer than private vehicles. Additionally, offering incentives or rewards for using TransMilenio during peak hours could shift behavior away from private car usage.”**

2. **HMW #4 (Question an Assumption)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we question the assumption that private vehicles are inherently safer than public transport during peak hours?  
   Answer: By analyzing external data on traffic accidents and congestion, we could compare the safety risks of private vehicles versus public transport…”**

3. **HMW #8 (Play Against the Challenge)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we encourage private vehicle owners to choose TransMilenio without the perception of safety issues being a deterrent?  
   Answer: By analyzing how private vehicle owners plan their trips and integrating features like on-demand services, improved security measures, and personalized travel suggestions…”**

4. **HMW #9 (Change a Status Quo)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we shift the perception of TransMilenio from a secondary option to the primary choice for commuting?  
   Answer: By improving real-time crowd management with AI, introducing incentives during peak hours (e.g., discounts or rewards for using TransMilenio), and enhancing safety, we could change how citizens view public transport…”**
