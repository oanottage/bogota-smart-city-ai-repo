# CLUSTER: TransMilenio Safety Challenges

## Point of View 2: 
"The lack of perceived safety in the TransMilenio, especially during peak hours, drives citizens to prefer private vehicles, further contributing to Bogotá's transportation challenges."
<b>Claim:</b> Citizens feel unsafe using TransMilenio, with overcrowding and security concerns deterring use (LINK 4-5 and Claim 5).
<b>Documents:</b> "Ciudad de Bolívar" and "Cartilla Encuesta de Movilidad 2023" discuss how security concerns, particularly during peak hours, contribute to the preference for private vehicles over public transportation, impacting Bogotá's goal of reducing congestion.
