## Analyzing Bogotá from a Smart City Perspective: A Comprehensive Overview
Introduction: Bogotá, the capital city of Colombia, stands as a blend of historical significance, cultural richness, and modern technological advancements. From the towering Andes mountains to the bustling urban streets, Bogotá offers a dynamic view of urban life. Analyzing the city from a smart city and AI perspective brings to light the complexities of its infrastructure, mobility, and efforts in shaping a sustainable, efficient, and technologically-driven environment.

Historical and Cultural Context
Bogotá's Past: Bogotá has a rich historical tapestry dating back to pre-colonial times when the indigenous Muisca people inhabited the region. Their culture, known as "Chipcha," is still a key aspect of Bogotá's identity. The city's evolution into a Spanish colonial hub, and later its rise as a democratic center, plays a significant role in its urban layout and cultural dynamism today. The Spanish influence left behind iconic landmarks such as the historic Candelaria neighborhood and significant religious structures, such as the Monserrate Sanctuary.

The city’s history also shapes its modern-day social fabric. The conflict between various ethnic groups, the indigenous populations, Afro-Colombians, and migrants, continues to influence the socio-political landscape. The city, with its varied cultural zones, reflects this diversity, and neighborhoods like Candelaria serve as a live canvas for art, history, and urban evolution.

Urban Infrastructure and Transportation
Mobility and Transportation: In the context of smart cities, Bogotá faces unique challenges and opportunities related to mobility and transportation. As one of the most populous cities in Latin America, its transportation system has to contend with issues of congestion, pollution, and accessibility. The TransMilenio system, which operates as a bus rapid transit (BRT) network, is a pivotal aspect of the city’s transportation infrastructure. The system, although efficient in some ways, faces criticisms due to overcrowding, delays, and maintenance challenges. From a smart city perspective, there’s a pressing need for the TransMilenio system to integrate with future technologies such as AI for traffic management, smart ticketing, and real-time scheduling.

A new metro system is under construction, with expectations to alleviate some of these transportation bottlenecks. However, the timeline for completion has faced delays, partially due to global factors like the COVID-19 pandemic. The metro system, once completed, is expected to revolutionize mobility by reducing traffic congestion and improving connectivity across the city. Additionally, the city’s integration of bikes and electric scooters (available through apps) showcases the city's move toward multimodal, tech-driven mobility solutions.

Public Transportation Challenges: Despite the ongoing efforts to enhance transportation infrastructure, Bogotá’s public transport system is often criticized for inefficiencies such as long wait times and limited coverage in certain areas. For instance, the TransMilenio’s bus network is only effective along the major corridors, and travelers often need to transfer to local buses to reach their final destinations, which can be time-consuming. With the introduction of AI and real-time data analytics, the city could better manage these transitions, offering passengers more seamless and timely travel.

Furthermore, Bogotá’s streets present another mobility challenge—most streets are designed for one-way traffic, creating significant bottlenecks during rush hours. This design, while efficient for minimizing congestion in some areas, forces drivers to make detours if they miss turns, contributing to the overall inefficiency of the transportation system.

Smart City Initiatives and AI Integration
AI-Powered Solutions for Mobility: AI and data analytics could play a significant role in enhancing Bogotá’s transportation efficiency. Through real-time traffic management, AI could help optimize traffic flow, reducing congestion. By analyzing data from various sensors and cameras across the city, AI could help predict traffic patterns, accidents, and potential bottlenecks, allowing for faster response times and alternative routing. Additionally, AI could be leveraged to improve public transport services, from better scheduling to predicting peak hours and adjusting routes in real-time based on passenger demand.

Smart Infrastructure: Bogotá is also exploring ways to integrate smart infrastructure into its urban fabric. The city is investing in digital connectivity, with free Wi-Fi zones in some areas and increasing the number of smart streetlights. The potential for a smart grid, where electricity usage is optimized based on real-time data, also holds promise for improving the city’s energy efficiency.

The integration of AI into the transportation ecosystem is also paving the way for future possibilities like autonomous vehicles and smart parking systems. Smart parking solutions could reduce the time wasted in finding parking spots, while autonomous taxis could eventually become a reality, reducing traffic and the need for personal car ownership.

Social and Economic Factors in a Smart City
Equity and Inclusion: A significant challenge in Bogotá is ensuring that the benefits of a smart city reach all its residents. Historically, there has been a geographic and socio-economic divide, with more affluent neighborhoods benefiting from better infrastructure and public services. For Bogotá to become a truly smart city, it will need to address this divide. AI-powered solutions, like inclusive smart bus routes, real-time data for residents in underserved neighborhoods, and affordable housing initiatives, can help ensure that technological advancements reach all sections of society, especially marginalized groups such as Afro-Colombians, indigenous people, and low-income residents.

Economic Development and Smart Cities: Economic disparities also extend to the labor market. While Bogotá is a hub for tech and software companies, the city faces challenges related to job creation in new industries. As AI and automation become more prevalent, it’s crucial for the city to invest in educational programs that teach digital skills, empowering residents to participate in the tech-driven economy. Moreover, AI can contribute to the growth of local businesses by providing tools for small business owners to better understand market trends, consumer behavior, and supply chain logistics.

Environmental Sustainability
Sustainability in a Smart City: As a high-altitude city, Bogotá experiences unique environmental challenges, including air pollution and limited green spaces. Smart city technologies like AI-powered environmental monitoring systems could help the city better track air quality and pollution levels, providing residents with real-time data on air quality. Furthermore, integrating green spaces into the urban design, especially as part of the public transportation system, could offer sustainable alternatives for city dwellers.

Bogotá’s transportation system could also benefit from AI solutions that promote electric vehicle adoption. Smart infrastructure, like electric vehicle charging stations, integrated with AI-based route optimization, could help reduce the city’s carbon footprint. In the long term, the creation of more walkable urban areas could help foster a culture of sustainability, encouraging residents to use public transport or walk instead of relying on personal vehicles.

Conclusion
Bogotá is well on its way to becoming a smart city, with advancements in transportation, AI integration, and smart infrastructure. However, challenges remain, particularly with transportation congestion, equitable access to smart city benefits, and environmental sustainability. The city's future success will depend on how well it leverages technology to create a more connected, efficient, and sustainable urban environment, all while addressing the social and economic disparities that currently divide its population. In the coming years, with the ongoing metro project and further integration of AI and IoT solutions, Bogotá has the potential to transform into a truly smart city, leading by example in Latin America.


## Ciudad de Bolivar

The tour of Bogotá, specifically the Ciudad Bolívar area, offers a fascinating exploration into the history, infrastructure, and ongoing transformation of a rapidly growing urban environment. From a smart city and AI perspective, this tour offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by a major city in Latin America. Here's a breakdown of the tour, highlighting relevant elements tied to the concept of a smart city, with a special focus on mobility, transportation, and the city's history.

Historical Context and Urban Development
Bogotá, as the capital of Colombia, has a rich and complex history that stretches back to its establishment by the Spanish in 1538. The city has evolved dramatically, with a significant focus on integrating various districts, improving urban infrastructure, and attempting to balance modernization with social equality. Ciudad Bolívar, once known for its association with illicit activities and poverty, has undergone considerable changes over the years.

Historically, Bogotá was marked by deep socioeconomic divides. The tour mentioned how neighborhoods like the Bronx area were once dominated by the informal economy, especially with illegal activities and the drug trade. However, after government interventions and policies aimed at revitalizing the area, much of the former problem areas are now becoming more organized with urban renewal projects. These shifts are significant for the smart city narrative, showing the importance of governance, urban planning, and public-private partnerships to transform underserved areas.

Transportation: A Study in Mobility and Smart Solutions
Transportation and mobility in Bogotá are at the forefront of its smart city initiatives. During the tour, we discussed how TransMilenio, Bogotá’s Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, plays a crucial role in urban mobility. This system serves as an efficient and low-cost means of getting around, helping to alleviate traffic congestion. However, the efficiency of the service still faces challenges due to the unpredictable timing of buses, as well as limited data transparency, where real-time updates in apps do not always align with actual arrival times. The use of GPS tracking in the buses, however, is a positive indicator of the city's attempts to integrate smart transportation solutions.

Another aspect of Bogotá's mobility that stands out is the cable car system, known as TransMiCable, which links the more elevated areas of the city with the rest of the transportation network. This system is especially beneficial for Ciudad Bolívar, where the rugged terrain and rapid population growth have historically made transportation difficult. The introduction of cable cars is part of an urban strategy to make previously isolated neighborhoods more accessible, thus improving mobility and reducing reliance on traditional buses or private cars.

The discussion also pointed to Bogotá's move toward integrated multi-modal transport, where individuals can switch seamlessly between cable cars, buses, and the metro (once fully operational), with the goal of creating a more cohesive and efficient transport system. From a smart city perspective, this requires the integration of AI for traffic management, big data for predictive modeling, and IoT for real-time communication across the transportation ecosystem.

However, the challenge remains in expanding these services to lower-income areas and maintaining equitable access to modern transportation, ensuring that the benefits of these innovations are felt citywide, particularly in the more peripheral neighborhoods.

Smart City Initiatives and Social Infrastructure
In terms of social infrastructure, Bogotá is experimenting with several smart initiatives. One area of focus is urban cleaning and waste management, a critical issue in neighborhoods like Ciudad Bolívar. The city has begun to invest in more frequent and organized waste collection, an initiative tied to AI-powered tracking to optimize collection routes and frequencies.

Additionally, the tour mentioned how public safety, historically a concern in neighborhoods with higher crime rates, is being enhanced through surveillance systems and police presence. The use of AI in law enforcement (like predictive policing) is something that Bogotá is increasingly exploring, although it remains a sensitive subject due to privacy concerns.

Urbanization and Housing: Informal Settlements and Smart Growth
The transformation of informal settlements in Bogotá is another essential element of the smart city vision. As mentioned during the tour, neighborhoods like the one the group visited have been home to refugees and displaced persons. These communities often live in informal housing with illegal utilities, which presents significant challenges in terms of urban planning and infrastructure development. The city's response, however, has been to provide some level of government assistance and gradually integrate these neighborhoods into the urban framework.

AI can play a role here by helping urban planners to identify the most sustainable development paths for these informal areas, using big data to understand population trends, infrastructure needs, and social dynamics. In the future, Bogotá could use AI to model urban expansion scenarios, helping to predict and plan for growth in a way that minimizes displacement and promotes inclusivity.

Environmental Challenges and Sustainability
As part of the ongoing efforts to manage Bogotá's growth, sustainability is a significant consideration. Issues such as polluted rivers, inadequate waste management systems, and the need for better green spaces are challenges that the city is working to address. AI can help manage environmental data, enabling the city to monitor pollution levels and implement better waste disposal systems. For example, sensors could be placed in rivers to track water quality, and data from IoT-enabled trash bins could help the city optimize waste collection routes, improving cleanliness and environmental health.

Additionally, the growth of public green spaces and parks, such as the ones in the Ciudad Bolívar area, is part of the city's broader sustainability and quality-of-life goals. These areas not only provide residents with much-needed recreational spaces but can also play a role in managing the urban heat island effect and improving the city's resilience to climate change.

Challenges and the Way Forward
While the tour highlighted many positive developments in Bogotá, it also underscored the challenges faced by a rapidly urbanizing city. Traffic congestion remains a pressing issue, particularly in the northern areas of the city. Although public transportation systems like TransMilenio and TransMiCable are helping alleviate this, traffic during rush hours continues to be a problem, requiring further optimization.

Moreover, internet connectivity remains a significant barrier in some parts of the city, as evidenced by the tour participant's issues with mobile data and the need for more consistent broadband access. The disparity in access to high-speed internet between different zones of the city, especially in low-income areas, presents a significant hurdle to fully realizing the potential of a smart city.

Conclusion: A City in Transition
Bogotá is a city of contrasts and opportunities. As a smart city, it is still in the early stages of integrating technology, data, and sustainable urban planning into everyday life. However, the steps it has taken in terms of mobility, social infrastructure, and environmental management show great promise. AI and IoT could play an essential role in tackling the city's remaining challenges, especially in terms of traffic management, public safety, and resource optimization. Bogotá’s progress in embracing smart city principles offers an inspiring model for other cities in Latin America and beyond, highlighting the importance of inclusive growth, technology adoption, and community engagement in creating cities of the future.


## CLAIMS

1. Claim 1: The Transporation and Mobility Industry has been known to experience vandalism ✅ - proven true

Article 1 reports that five new TransMilenio buses were vandalized—graffiti, smashed parts, and broken windows—with one vehicle’s repair cost estimated at around 10 million pesos, and several buses taken out of service for days. This example shows that vandalism leads directly to repair expenses and operational disruptions, which would raise the fixed costs for the system.
Thus, Article 1 supports Claim 1 by providing a concrete example of how vandalism increases expenses.
(Reference: https://bogota.gov.co/mi-ciudad/movilidad/transmilenio/buses-de-transmilenio-vandalizados)

Article 2 details widespread vandalism across Bogotá’s public transport infrastructure, noting that 101 stations were rendered inoperable and physical damages have amounted to billions of pesos. Although it covers a broader context than just TransMilenio, the article clearly indicates that vandalism imposes heavy financial costs on public transport infrastructure.
Thus, Article 2 supports Claim 1 by reinforcing that vandalism leads to high repair costs, contributing to the system’s financial deficits.
(Reference: https://concejodebogota.gov.co/sin-antecedentes-las-perdidas-que-deja-el-vandalismo-en-bogota/cbogota/2019-11-28/080244.php)

Artile 3 discusses the general climate of unrest and reports instances of vandalism and looting amid nationwide protests. However, it does not specifically tie the acts of vandalism to increased operating costs or deficits within the TransMilenio system.
Thus, while Article 3 provides context for a broader environment where vandalism occurs, its connection to the financial deficit caused by vandalism in TransMilenio is indirect and less focused.
(Reference: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50531816)

Article 4 describes the Supreme Court’s decision to sentence an influencer (Epa Colombia) for vandalizing a TransMilenio station. The legal repercussions and the public nature of the case underscore that vandalism in the system is taken seriously and that such acts incur additional costs—both in terms of physical repair and potential service disruption.
Thus, Article 4 supports Claim 1 by documenting a specific act of vandalism on TransMilenio infrastructure, implying increased fixed costs through damage and subsequent legal and repair actions.
(Reference: https://telecafe.gov.co/corte-suprema-confirma-condena-de-5-anos-para-epa-colombia-por-vandalismo-en-transmilenio/)

Similar to Article 4, Article 5 recounts the case of Epa Colombia, confirming her arrest and sentencing for damaging TransMilenio facilities. It reiterates that vandalism is not only a public safety concern but also a financial one, as the damages require costly repairs and contribute to operational losses.
Thus, Article 5 further supports Claim 1 by providing additional evidence of vandalism directly affecting TransMilenio’s infrastructure and operating costs.

2. LINK (1-2): Vandalisms contribue to the high fixed cost expenses of the Transmilenial ✅

ARTICLE 6:
<b>Headline and Context:</b>
The title itself mentions that Transmilenio’s finances are “affected by the pandemic and vandalism.” This implies that vandalism is one of the factors negatively impacting the system’s financial status.
<b>Impact of Vandalism on Operations:</b>
The article notes that vandalism (along with blockades) has aggravated the financial challenges facing Transmilenio. It states that the system is operating without 51 stations because the damage renders them unsafe or inoperable.
*“In recent weeks, this situation has been aggravated by blockades and vandalism. According to the company's most recent report, the system is operating without 51 of its stations, which, due to the damage, are not in condition to guarantee safety or operation for users.”*
<b>Financial Impact of the Damage:</b>
<br>
The manager, Felipe Ramírez, quantifies the damage from vandalism at $16 billion. Although this figure is not directly added to the deficit number in the article, it implies that the costs required to repair or replace the damaged infrastructure are a significant financial burden that contributes to the overall deficit.
*“According to Ramírez, the damages amount to $16 billion.”*
https://www.elespectador.com/bogota/finanzas-de-transmilenio-afectadas-por-la-pandemia-y-el-vandalismo-article/

ARTICLE 7:
Article 2, which discusses the broader impact of vandalism in Bogotá, reports that acts of vandalism have left 101 stations out of service and caused extensive physical damage (with figures such as 5 billion pesos in physical damage). This article reinforces the notion that vandalism has led to substantial losses in public transport infrastructure, including Transmilenio.
https://concejodebogota.gov.co/sin-antecedentes-las-perdidas-que-deja-el-vandalismo-en-bogota/cbogota/2019-11-28/080244.php



3. Claim 2: And therefore Transmilenio is operating at a deficit ✅ - proven true

Vandalisms contribue to the high fixed cost expenses of the Transmilenial ✅ - proven true
<b>Deficit Figures:</b>
<br>
Article 8 states that Transmilenio had a deficit of almost $1.1 billion in 2019. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic (which led to a sharp drop in ridership) and other operational challenges, the system *“could close 2021 with a deficit of $2.2 billion.”*
*“…the deficit that Transmilenio had in 2019, which was almost $1.1 billion, an amount that with the pandemic, according to Ramírez, could close 2021 at $2.2 billion.”*
<br>
<b>Operational Conditions:</b>
<br>
The article explains that, even with a drop in demand, Transmilenio had to operate at 100% of its fleet (by order of the authorities), which increased its operating costs beyond its income. This situation has contributed to the overall financial shortfall.
*“This is not a situation exclusive to the capital, but to the entire world. Transportation systems are underfunded,”* says Felipe Ramírez, manager of TM.


4. LINK (2-3): Due to that low profit margin (deficit), theres insufficient investment opportunities for the transmilenio ❌
See claim 3.0 - There is no proof of insufficient shuttle quantity, and so there's no need to link this claim to the insufficient investment opportunities.

5. Claim 3: Therefore there aren't sufficient Transmilenio shuttles to expand ❌

ARTICLE 9 shows that there is no evidence that TransMilenio is operating with a low quantity of shuttles; rather, it describes a system that has grown rapidly and handles a very high capacity of passengers. For example, the article states:

“By late 2002, it was already transporting 650,000 passengers per day in 38‐kilometer exclusive bus lanes, with 62 bus stations and 470 articulated buses” (Sandoval & Hidalgo, 2004).

It later adds:

“Nowadays, the system covers more than 112 kilometers of dedicated lanes, has 134 bus stations, and moves almost 2 million passengers every day, accounting for 30% of the city’s total demand for public transportation” (Transmilenio, 2017).

Furthermore, the article notes that in July 2019 Transmilenio announced the purchase of 600 electric buses, described as:

“constituting the largest fleet of electric buses in Latin America” (Transmilenio, 2019).

None of these points support the claim that Transmilenio is operating with a low quantity of shuttles. On the contrary, the data indicate that the system has not only a large fleet but is also actively expanding it, suggesting that budgetary or operational deficits (if any exist) have not led to an undersized fleet. Thus, the article effectively disproves—or at least does not support—the claim that the Transmilenio is operating with too few shuttles.
https://www.redalyc.org/journal/2734/273469809007/html/


6. LINK (3-4): Due to the insufficient shuttle quantity, the Transmilenio has to operate in areas having the most people ❌
See claim 3.0 - There is no proof of insufficient shuttle quantity, and so there's no need to link this claim to the population density.

7. Claim 4: The Transmilenio terminals are in areas with high population density ✅
Easy enough, we just needed to find an article that overlays the transmilenio map with the population heatmap of the city, and we did, and it shows that the terminals do in fact reside in areas with high population density.

8. LINK (4-5) These densely populated areas where the terminals are located, are the areas with the most incidences ✅
Let's do some data science stuff for this one
Incidents
Here I'm going to get the code I cleaned from security_llamadas.ipynb and prepare it for a KMeans Clustering. I have it set to a clustering of 5 without analysis because I want to grade each location on the amount of incidents from A to E.

N.B. The population and density is not a factor in this and so we would not be able to say exactly what the distribution of incidents is like.
For example, there could be:
- an area with a high population, and a low incident rate > even lower % of incidents
- an area with a high population, and a high incident rate > low % of incidents
- an area with a low population, and a low incident rate > low % of incidents
- an area with a low population, and a high incident rate > even higher % of incidents

This analysis doesn't account for this, and just assumes that the number of incidents are directly proportional to the population.
Stupid, I know, but I don't have much time for this project, so feel free to correct it if it's wrong :)
So here, I just get the data
# Import required libraries
import os

# Data manipulation libraries
import pandas as pd
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Machine learning libraries
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Geospatial libraries
import geopandas as gpd
import folium
from folium.features import GeoJsonTooltip
import branca.colormap as cm

load_dotenv()

BASE_PATH = os.getenv('BASE_PATH')

if not BASE_PATH or not os.path.exists(BASE_PATH):
    raise ValueError(f"Invalid BASE_PATH: {BASE_PATH}. Check your .env file")

raw = pd.read_parquet(os.path.join(BASE_PATH, 'data/2_Silver/incidences.parquet')) # data cleaned in security_llamadas.ipynb
This is what the data looks like when I get it:
raw.head()
Now I clean the data a bit:
df = raw.copy()

# save 'COD_UPZ', 'UPZ', 'LOCALIDAD' columns to be concatenated with the data after the clustering, don't drop anything
df_mapping = df[['COD_UPZ', 'UPZ', 'LOCALIDAD']]

# drop the COD_UPZ	UPZ	LOCALIDAD columns
df.drop(columns=['COD_UPZ', 'UPZ', 'LOCALIDAD'], inplace=True)
This is how the data looks once I remove the not important stuff:
df.head()
Now I prepare this information for my Machine Learning Algorithm (KMeans Clustering):
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
df_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(df), columns=df.columns)
X = df_scaled.select_dtypes(include=["number"]).values
Here's how it looks after I've prepared it to teach the algorithm, 
<br>
it's the same information, it's just in a format that the computer can understand:
X
Now here I'm using a Machine Learning Algorithm called KMeans Clustering

<br>
The whole point is for me to figure out which scores to give these neighborhoods.
<br>

But the problem is that I don't have the time or energy to analyze them, and so I'm going
<br>
to let KMeans figure this out insetead. It's going to group (or cluster in this sense)
<br>
all of the data from each incident (fight, vandalism, etc.) and group the neighborhoods
<br>
together based on that information.
# perform k means clustering on X
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=0).fit(X)

# add the cluster labels to the dataframe
df['cluster'] = kmeans.labels_ + 1
If you scroll all the way to the right, you can see that it made clusters, and identified this particular group and labelled it 2 out of 5
df.head()
What I'm going to do now is analyze the groups. I'm going to sum all the incidents together, and then get the average by the clusters
# sum all the incidents except cluster into a column called 'total_incidents' 
df['total_incidents'] = df.drop(columns='cluster').sum(axis=1)
# Let's analyze the clusters
df.groupby('cluster').mean().sort_values('total_incidents', ascending=False)
From the above, you can see that the average of the total number of incidents aren't in order
<br>

For the clusters, lets Label 4 'A', Label 1 'B', Label 5 'C', Label 3 'D', Label 2 'E' correspoding to the amount of incidents
df['cluster'] = df['cluster'].map({4: 'A', 1: 'B', 5: 'C', 3: 'D', 2: 'E'})
df.groupby('cluster').mean().sort_values('total_incidents', ascending=False)
Now we have the scores of our neighborhoods from A to E, now we can add our neighborhoods back
# append the df_mapping to the df
df_final = df_mapping.join(df)
df_final.head()
From this we have a score for each UPZ, but it's all tabular data, so let's jump into another section where we can view it on a map
# Geospatial Mapping
Here I'm just getting the geospatial data that we found useful during the security_llamadas.ipynb analysis
# Now let's get the geospatial dataframe
parquet_file = os.path.join(BASE_PATH,"data/1_Bronze/geo_crnupz.parquet")
raw = gpd.read_parquet(parquet_file)
Here's what the dataset looks like, we'll get rid of some of these columns in a sec|
geo_crnupz = raw.copy()
geo_crnupz.head()
Told you ;)
geo_crnupz = geo_crnupz[['CMIUUPLA','CMRNTOTAL','SHAPE.AREA','SHAPE.LEN','geometry']]
geo_crnupz = geo_crnupz.drop_duplicates(subset=['CMIUUPLA'])
geo_crnupz.head()
Now we have to merge the incidents to the geospatial data so we can show it on the map
incidents_geo_merge = df_final.merge(geo_crnupz, left_on='COD_UPZ', right_on='CMIUUPLA', how='left')
incidents_geo_merge = gpd.GeoDataFrame(incidents_geo_merge, geometry='geometry')
incidents_geo_merge = incidents_geo_merge.drop(columns='CMIUUPLA')
incidents_geo_merge
And now... for the grand finale! Let's show the map. Don't worry about the code, it works, that's all that matters.
center = [
    incidents_geo_merge.geometry.centroid.y.mean(), 
    incidents_geo_merge.geometry.centroid.x.mean()
]
m = folium.Map(location=center, zoom_start=12)

# Define the order of clusters
cluster_order = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']

# Create a sequential colormap (shades of blue) for numeric values 1 (A) to 5 (E)
colormap = cm.linear.Blues_09.scale(1, 5)
colormap.caption = "FIGHTING INCIDENT SCALE (A to E)"

def style_function(feature):
    # Get the cluster label from the properties
    cluster = feature["properties"]["cluster"]
    try:
        # Convert the cluster label (A, B, C, D, E) to a numeric value (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
        numeric_value = cluster_order.index(cluster) + 1
    except ValueError:
        numeric_value = 0  # Or choose a default if the value isn't found
    return {
        "fillColor": colormap(numeric_value),
        "color": "white",
        "weight": 1,
        "fillOpacity": 0.7,
    }
	
tooltip_fields = [
    "UPZ",
    "COD_UPZ",
    "LOCALIDAD",
    "total_incidents",
    "cluster"
]

tooltip_aliases = [
    "ZONE NAME",
    "ZONE ID",
    "AREA",
    "INCIDENTS",
    "SCORE"
]

tooltip = GeoJsonTooltip(
    fields=tooltip_fields,
    aliases=tooltip_aliases,
    labels=True,
    sticky=True
)

folium.GeoJson(
    data=incidents_geo_merge.__geo_interface__,  # Convert your GeoDataFrame to GeoJSON format
    name="INCIDENTS BY AREA",
    tooltip=tooltip,
    style_function=style_function
).add_to(m)

m.save(os.path.join(BASE_PATH, "data/maps/incidents_geo_merge.html"))
m

Now that we have our map, we just need to do a layover with the transmilenio line. Any terminal that touches an area with a D or E status, I'll mark red, and if it's not I'll mark it green.
![image.png](attachment:image.png)
As you can see, 12 out of 15 terminals are next to an area that are more prone to incidents happenining.
<br>
This validates our claim that the transmilenial operates in areas with the most incidents.

9. Claim 5: Citizens feel unsafe or uncomfortable using the Transmilenio (Health & Safety) ✅
With this claim, we need to find some secondary statistics (city wide stats) on transportation and mobility, no more than 5 years old that can verify our claim.

Cartilla Encuesta de Movilidad 2023
8.4 Eleccion del modo de transporte
![image.png](attachment:image.png)
3% of the population reported changing modes strictly due to “public security” issues, and owning a car can mitigate perceived security risks.

Although the survey indicates only about 3% of the overall population explicitly changed modes for security reasons, fear of petty theft, harassment, or other criminal activity on buses or at stations still exists as a deterrent.

Even a relatively small rate of reported incidents can elevate the perceived risk of traveling on crowded buses, especially in certain neighborhoods or at night.

8.5 Percepcion del servicio"
![image.png](attachment:image.png)
When asked about comfort, safety, service quality, and reliability, private car consistently receives higher overall ratings than public transport. Public transport was rated especially low in security/public order.

The TransMilenio can get extremely crowded at peak times. Long rides under cramped conditions can be physically taxing, especially for older adults, people with disabilities, or anyone traveling with young children.

A private car offers secure, personal space, allowing for temperature control, seat comfort, and a more relaxing environment.
Greater Control Over Hygiene Conditions

Post-pandemic, some users are sensitive to cleanliness and crowding. Car owners feel less exposed to possible infections or unsanitary conditions, reinforcing their choice to drive.

While public transportation authorities can enforce cleaning protocols, the sense of personal control in one’s own vehicle is generally higher.

## WHY PERSONS ARE NOT SWITCHING THEIR MODE OF TRANSPORT TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

1. Time Savings – High Value Placed on Personal Time
Subjective Monetary Value of Time

According to the survey’s preference-declared (PD) findings, many car users assign a notably high monetary value to each minute saved. On average, COP $224 per minute is quoted for auto users, indicating they view potential time losses (e.g., traffic jams or public-transport waiting) as more “costly” than direct expenses (fuel, tolls, parking).
This means a 30-minute door-to-door journey in a personal car could be seen as “worth” well over COP $6,000–$7,000 in opportunity cost.
In simpler terms, people with higher time valuations prefer to avoid the unpredictability or longer durations often experienced in public transport (especially if it involves multiple transfers).
Opportunity Cost of Delays

Public transport trips can include uncertain waiting times, transfers, and crowded conditions—factors that car owners perceive as “unproductive” or wasted. Each additional minute waiting for a bus or stuck in a crowded platform is seen as a direct personal cost.
The higher a person’s income or the more rigid their personal/professional commitments, the more that any wasted time translates into financial or lifestyle losses.
Trip-Chaining Simplicity

People who have several daily errands—dropping children at school, shopping, or visiting multiple locations—save time and simplify logistics in a private car. They see it as more efficient than planning a multi-leg trip on different public-transport routes.
2. Door-to-Door Convenience – Flexibility in Route and Timing
Control Over Departure & Arrival Times

Personal vehicle owners can leave precisely when they want and arrive closer to their destinations, circumventing the “last-mile” problem often present in public transport (i.e., walking from bus stations or TransMilenio stops to the final address).
This is particularly helpful for people whose activities are spread out (e.g., across multiple zones of the city) or whose schedules are not well aligned with public transport frequencies.
Adaptability to Unexpected Changes

If a rider needs to make a sudden stop—such as picking up an item or changing plans mid-route—private cars allow route changes on the fly.
Public transport usually involves fixed routes, fixed stops, and potentially limited service in off-peak hours (e.g., late-night or early-morning travel).
Reduced “Trip Stages”

Public transport in Bogotá–Región often entails several legs: walking to a station, waiting, possibly transferring lines, and then walking again at the end. Car trips, in contrast, tend to be one continuous ride (even if slower at times due to congestion).
3. Security & Comfort – Desire to Avoid Perceived Risks in Public Transport
Perceptions of Public Security

Although the survey indicates only about 3% of the overall population explicitly changed modes for security reasons, fear of petty theft, harassment, or other criminal activity on buses or at stations still exists as a deterrent.
Even a relatively small rate of reported incidents can elevate the perceived risk of traveling on crowded buses, especially in certain neighborhoods or at night.
Physical Comfort & Personal Space

Vehicles such as TransMilenio (bus rapid transit) can get extremely crowded at peak times. Long rides under cramped conditions can be physically taxing, especially for older adults, people with disabilities, or anyone traveling with young children.
A private car offers secure, personal space, allowing for temperature control, seat comfort, and a more relaxing environment.
Greater Control Over Hygiene Conditions

Post-pandemic, some users are sensitive to cleanliness and crowding. Car owners feel less exposed to possible infections or unsanitary conditions, reinforcing their choice to drive.
While public transportation authorities can enforce cleaning protocols, the sense of personal control in one’s own vehicle is generally higher.
4. Ability to Pay – Higher-Income Households More Willing to Pay for Fees & Restrictions
Pico y Placa Solidario (Paid Exemption)

Survey results show that over 50% of users in estratos 5 and 6 (the highest income brackets) prefer to pay for an exemption to the pico y placa restriction rather than alter their travel schedules or switch modes.
This willingness indicates that the additional cost (hundreds of thousands of pesos per month) is seen as a lesser inconvenience compared to the perceived time and comfort lost if forced to use public transport.
Parking, Tolls, and Operational Costs

Costs like fuel, parking, car insurance, or tolls are more manageable for higher-income households. Consequently, these costs do not outweigh the benefits of time savings and personal convenience.
For lower- and middle-income families, these recurring costs represent a heavier burden and can deter vehicle ownership.
Upfront Purchase Power

The capacity to purchase and maintain a vehicle (or even to choose hybrid/electric models) correlates strongly with higher household incomes in the city. The ongoing expenses are less prohibitive in those households, leading them to continue using cars as their main travel option.

5. Unreliable Public Transport – Concerns About Long Waits, Overcrowding, and Safety
Frequency & Overcrowding Issues

Some corridors and feeder routes suffer from inconsistent frequencies, especially in non-peak hours (late evenings, weekends). This creates uncertainty that private car users do not face.
Overcrowding at peak times can also be a deterrent, making the ride physically uncomfortable. While the SITP (Sistema Integrado de Transporte Público) attempts to standardize routes and fleets, the perception remains mixed among many citizens.
Complex Transfers & Multiple Fare Systems

Multistage trips may require separate fares or time-consuming transfers. Even though there’s an integrated payment system, the practical experience (long walks between stations, lines, or across busy roads) often remains cumbersome.
For travelers needing several stops in a single trip (such as errands plus a school pick-up), having a private car is simpler and can be faster overall.
Perceived Lack of Service Quality

In the survey’s user-satisfaction ratings, public transport scores relatively low in comfort, safety (both road-safety and security), and reliability. Meanwhile, the same ratings for private cars are higher, reinforcing the decision to keep using them.

# Summary
These five factors interconnect, creating a strong incentive loop for those who can afford to own and operate a personal vehicle. From time savings and door-to-door convenience to concerns over security, financial capacity, and public transport reliability, the survey data reveal that private cars address pain points that public transit has not yet fully resolved—particularly for higher-income users or people with demanding schedules.

Overcoming this preference requires ongoing improvements—expanding high-quality, reliable transit routes; addressing security concerns; and ensuring robust, integrated, and frequent services that rival the convenience of private vehicles.
