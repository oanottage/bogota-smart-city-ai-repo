## DEBONO HATS PHASE 2

## Point of View 2: 
"The lack of perceived safety in the TransMilenio, especially during peak hours, drives citizens to prefer private vehicles, further contributing to Bogotá's transportation challenges."
<b>Claim:</b> Citizens feel unsafe using TransMilenio, with overcrowding and security concerns deterring use (LINK 4-5 and Claim 5).
<b>Documents:</b> "Ciudad de Bolívar" and "Cartilla Encuesta de Movilidad 2023" discuss how security concerns, particularly during peak hours, contribute to the preference for private vehicles over public transportation, impacting Bogotá's goal of reducing congestion.

## Cluster 6: Community & User Engagement

**Focus:** Involve passengers and local communities to foster collective ownership of safety and continuous feedback loops.

### From **How Might We (HMW)**

1. **HMW #7 (Create an Analogy from Need or Context)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we think of TransMilenio as a ‘community garden’ where safety is cultivated collectively, not just enforced?  
   Answer: Just as a garden requires continuous nurturing, TransMilenio can be viewed as a shared space that thrives on communal care. AI could suggest ways to increase passenger involvement…maintain a sense of security.”**

### From **SCAMPER**

1. **SCAMPER #5 (P – Put to Another Use)**  
   > **“Put Social Media Sentiment Analysis to Another Use  
   Example: Use the same social media sentiment analysis tools to gauge public perception of safety in real time…increasing security presence when negative sentiment spikes.”**

### From **Lotus Flower**

1. **Sub-Theme #5: User Feedback Integration**  
  > **“Passengers are a valuable source of real-world insights…  
  - Real-time survey responses  
  - Sentiment analysis algorithms  
  - Social media mining  
  - Feedback sentiment dashboards  
  - Crowdsourced reporting app  
  - Voice feedback processing  
  - User rating system  
  - Experience mapping analytics”**

2. **Sub-Theme #8: Community Safety Initiatives**  
  > **“Engaging the community fosters a shared sense of responsibility…  
  - Neighborhood watch programs  
  - Community patrol apps  
  - Local engagement campaigns  
  - Safety education workshops  
  - Public trust surveys  
  - Volunteer safety ambassadors  
  - Collaborative security forums  
  - Community feedback loops”**

## White Hat (Facts and Information):
* Public transport issues: TransMilenio struggles with overcrowding, low ratings for safety, and a lack of reliability, especially during peak hours.
* Car use: Private cars are preferred due to their comfort, control over hygiene, and safety, particularly in light of safety concerns in public transport.
* Safety data: 3% of the population has switched modes due to security issues, and public transport is rated poorly for safety (2/5).
TransMilenio’s service challenges: Buses often face delays and traffic congestion.


## Red Hat (Feelings and Emotions):
* Fear and discomfort: There are strong emotional reactions to safety concerns, overcrowding, and cleanliness in public transport, leading to feelings of anxiety and discomfort.
* Desire for safety: Participants express a desire for a safer, more comfortable travel experience.
* Stress and anxiety: Drivers also feel stressed due to safety concerns during their shifts, further highlighting the need for improvement.

## Yellow Hat (Positives and Benefits):
* Benefits of improvement: If TransMilenio is improved (safer, cleaner, and more reliable), it could reduce traffic congestion by encouraging more people to use public transport.
* Cost-effectiveness: Public transport is more affordable compared to owning a private car, especially if service quality improves.
* Workforce morale: Improved safety and service quality would enhance the work environment for drivers and could reduce their stress.

## Black Hat (Risks and Challenges):
* Skepticism about comfort: Even with improvements, private cars may still be perceived as more comfortable, and people might not fully trust the public system.
* Overcrowding: Public transport may remain crowded and inefficient, leading to concerns about long waits and delays.
* Infrastructure limitations: Existing road conditions and infrastructure are significant barriers, making it difficult to fully resolve inefficiencies, even with improvements.
* Cost of improvements: The investment needed to overhaul the system and infrastructure might be a major obstacle.

## Green Hat (Creativity and Solutions):
* Private vehicle option: Introducing express or luxury services within the TransMilenio system to cater to those seeking comfort.
* AI and real-time tracking: Implementing predictive AI for smarter scheduling and reducing delays, along with better tracking of buses.
* Specialized services: Develop specialized services for commuters who prefer comfort or a quieter, less crowded experience.
* Security enhancements: Integrating real-time security monitoring and automated safety features could make passengers feel safer and more at ease.
