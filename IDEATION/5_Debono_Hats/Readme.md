1. The White Hat calls for information known or needed. “The facts, just the facts.”

2. The Yellow Hat symbolizes brightness and optimism. Under this hat you explore the positives and probe for value and benefit.

3. The Black hat focuses on Risks, difficulties, Problems – The risk management Hat, probably the most powerful Hat; a problem however if overused; spot difficulties where things might go wrong, why something may not work, inherently an action hat with the intent to point out issues of risk with intent to overcome them.

## Proposed Sequence
Blue Hat (Opening)

Purpose: Set the stage.
Moderator’s Role:
Outline the topic or challenge to be discussed.
Explain how the Six Thinking Hats process will work.
Set ground rules (e.g., “We’ll focus on one hat at a time, no judgment or cross-talk outside the current hat perspective.”).
Why first: The Blue Hat is the “control hat.” Starting with it clarifies goals and keeps the session organized from the beginning.
White Hat

Purpose: Collect and review factual information.
Moderator’s Role:
Ask participants to state facts, figures, relevant data, or known constraints.
Record them visibly (e.g., on a flip chart or virtual whiteboard).
Why second: Before discussing opinions or brainstorming solutions, it’s crucial that everyone has the same factual grounding and shared knowledge base.
Red Hat (Initial Emotions)

Purpose: Surface gut reactions, feelings, and intuitions.
Moderator’s Role:
Invite participants to share how they feel about the topic (excited, worried, hopeful, etc.).
Keep it succinct—no need to justify or explain why, just the emotional response.
Why here: After clarifying the facts, an early “pulse-check” helps ensure that unspoken anxieties, enthusiasm, or biases become explicit. This can prevent hidden tension from derailing later discussion.
Yellow Hat

Purpose: Explore the positive, optimistic view.
Moderator’s Role:
Prompt the group: “What’s good about this idea/challenge? What are its benefits?”
Encourage them to look for potential value or opportunities.
Why now: Looking at the upsides first helps foster an open, constructive mindset before tackling potential problems.
Black Hat

Purpose: Identify risks, difficulties, and obstacles.
Moderator’s Role:
Ask participants to adopt a critical, risk-spotting stance: “What could go wrong? Where might this fail?”
Emphasize that the goal is to strengthen ideas by uncovering weaknesses, not simply to dismiss them.
Why now: Once the group has seen the positives, they can use the Black Hat to responsibly explore pitfalls or problems. This balance of Yellow → Black ensures you don’t overlook either strengths or potential flaws.
Green Hat

Purpose: Generate creative solutions and new ideas.
Moderator’s Role:
Encourage “out-of-the-box” thinking, brainstorming, and possible ways to overcome the Black Hat’s concerns.
Build on each other’s ideas—defer judgment, aim for quantity.
Why now: Having both the positives and the pitfalls clearly laid out provides perfect springboards for innovation and creative problem-solving.
Red Hat (Optional Second Round)

Purpose: Check how emotions or gut feelings might have shifted.
Moderator’s Role:
Briefly ask: “Now that you’ve heard the positives, negatives, and new ideas, how are you feeling about the situation?”
Compare or contrast this with the initial emotional responses.
Why here: A quick second Red Hat can reveal if concerns have been addressed or if enthusiasm has grown or waned after the creative solutions. This step is optional but can provide extra clarity on the group’s emotional state.
Blue Hat (Closing)

Purpose: Summarize outcomes and decide next steps.
Moderator’s Role:
Recap the main points, insights, and action items from each hat’s perspective.
Outline how decisions will be made or actions will be implemented.
Assign follow-up tasks, if any.
Why last: The Blue Hat ensures a structured wrap-up, turning the varied perspectives into a coherent plan and clarifying responsibilities.



## Tips for the Moderator
Time Management

Decide how long you’ll spend on each hat before the session. Some hats (like Green or Black) may require more time depending on the complexity of the topic.
Enforce the “Hat” Mindset

Encourage participants to “wear one hat at a time.” If someone drifts into criticism during the Yellow Hat phase, gently remind them: “We’re still on Yellow; let’s keep the focus on benefits.”
Use Visual Cues

Have physical hats or colored cards (virtual or real) to remind participants which hat is in use. This helps keep everyone aligned.
Record Key Points

Keep notes or use a whiteboard for each hat:
White: facts & figures
Red: emotional words or short phrases
Yellow: benefits & opportunities
Black: risks & pitfalls
Green: new ideas & possible solutions
Adapt If Needed

If the group seems stuck or if new data emerges, you can momentarily revisit the White Hat or inject a brief “Red Hat check-in.” The hats are a framework, not a prison—use them flexibly.
Keep It Moving

Aim for momentum. If a topic under one hat is exhausted, switch hats rather than dragging the conversation. The Blue Hat’s role is to manage transitions.


## Summary
Start and end with the Blue Hat to guide the session and then conclude with decisions or next steps.
Use the White Hat early to share all relevant facts.
Red Hat helps surface emotional reactions—doing this before and/or after exploring pros/cons can uncover shifts in perspective.
Yellow then Black ensures a balanced look at positives and risks.
Green fuels creative possibilities to address challenges raised.
A second Red Hat can capture how ideas and solutions might have influenced emotions.
Finally, return to Blue Hat for a clear
