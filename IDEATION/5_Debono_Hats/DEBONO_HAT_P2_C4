## DEBONO HATS PHASE 2

## Point of View 2: 
"The lack of perceived safety in the TransMilenio, especially during peak hours, drives citizens to prefer private vehicles, further contributing to Bogotá's transportation challenges."
<b>Claim:</b> Citizens feel unsafe using TransMilenio, with overcrowding and security concerns deterring use (LINK 4-5 and Claim 5).
<b>Documents:</b> "Ciudad de Bolívar" and "Cartilla Encuesta de Movilidad 2023" discuss how security concerns, particularly during peak hours, contribute to the preference for private vehicles over public transportation, impacting Bogotá's goal of reducing congestion.

## Cluster 4: Data Analytics & Predictive Analysis

**Focus:** Use AI, external data, and enhanced data collection methods for proactive problem-solving.

### From **How Might We (HMW)**

1. **HMW #6 (Identify Unexpected Resources)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we use data from other cities with successful public transportation systems to improve safety and convenience in TransMilenio?  
   Answer: By analyzing the open data of other cities…AI can provide insights into successful strategies…that could be adapted for Bogotá.”**

2. **HMW #10 (Break PoV into Pieces)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we break down the point of view about safety concerns during peak hours into specific times, locations, and risk factors?  
   Answer: AI can analyze patterns to identify high-risk times and areas, allowing for targeted solutions such as adjusted scheduling, additional security…at specific stations.”**

### From **SCAMPER**

1. **SCAMPER #4 (M – Modify)**  
   > **“Modify Data Collection Techniques  
   Example: Enhance existing data collection methods by incorporating additional external data sources…to provide a more holistic view of the factors affecting safety during peak hours.”**

2. **SCAMPER #6 (E – Eliminate)**  
   > **“Eliminate Redundant Data Sources  
   Example: Use AI to analyze the quality and relevance of various open data sources…Eliminate redundant or low-quality data streams to streamline analytics and focus on actionable insights.”**

### From **Lotus Flower**

- **Sub-Theme #4: Predictive Safety Analytics**  
  > **“Leveraging data analytics to predict and preempt safety issues can transform reactive measures into proactive ones.  
  - Historical incident analysis  
  - Machine learning forecasting  
  - Risk pattern identification  
  - Trend anomaly detection  
  - Behavioral predictive modeling  
  - Predictive maintenance scheduling  
  - Simulation safety scenarios  
  - Data-driven risk scoring”**

## White Hat (Facts and Information):
* TransMilenio handles millions of passengers daily but faces significant issues: overcrowding, delays, and safety concerns (e.g., theft and harassment).
* Private cars are preferred by many due to comfort and safety but contribute to traffic congestion.
* The government and operational bodies are working on improving the system through technology and increased security.
* Specific neighborhoods have higher rates of incidents, and these areas are prioritized for interventions.

## Red Hat (Feelings and Emotions):
* Frustration and unease were common feelings, particularly about overcrowding and safety issues. People often feel unsafe, uncomfortable, and helpless in crowded buses or during incidents.
* Some participants felt a sense of duty and pressure to improve the system, while others expressed conflict about the balance between safety and convenience.

## Yellow Hat (Positives and Benefits):
* Improved public transport could reduce traffic congestion and pollution, making the city more environmentally friendly.
* It would save passengers time and money by reducing traffic and providing more reliable service.
* Increased safety through technology and better management could improve the experience for both passengers and employees.
* Expanding and improving the service would make it a more accessible and inclusive option for people who don’t own cars.

## Black Hat (Risks and Challenges):
* Technological challenges: New systems might not work as expected or fail to address all the issues.
* High costs and slow implementation: Investments needed to upgrade the system may not show immediate results.
* Safety concerns: Even with technological improvements, there’s a risk of increased incidents if public behavior doesn’t change.
* Overcrowding: More passengers could strain the system, worsening the very issues being addressed.
Political and financial constraints could delay or block progress.

## Green Hat (Creativity and Solutions):
* Real-time tracking apps for buses to help passengers avoid overcrowding and plan their trips more efficiently.
* Priority lanes for buses to ensure quicker travel during peak hours.
* Real-time data integration between traffic and bus schedules to optimize bus movement and reduce delays.
* Training for drivers on managing safety and introducing new safety features like cameras and panic buttons on buses.
* AI for crime prevention by predicting hotspots and placing officers in high-risk areas.
Expanding coverage into underserved areas with increased safety measures to encourage more users to switch to public transport.
