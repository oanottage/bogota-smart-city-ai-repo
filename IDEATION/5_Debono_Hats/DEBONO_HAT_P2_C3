## DEBONO HATS PHASE 2

## Point of View 2: 
"The lack of perceived safety in the TransMilenio, especially during peak hours, drives citizens to prefer private vehicles, further contributing to Bogotá's transportation challenges."
<b>Claim:</b> Citizens feel unsafe using TransMilenio, with overcrowding and security concerns deterring use (LINK 4-5 and Claim 5).
<b>Documents:</b> "Ciudad de Bolívar" and "Cartilla Encuesta de Movilidad 2023" discuss how security concerns, particularly during peak hours, contribute to the preference for private vehicles over public transportation, impacting Bogotá's goal of reducing congestion.

## Cluster 3: Encouraging Usage & Behavior Change

**Focus:** Shift user habits away from private cars by making TransMilenio more appealing, safe, and rewarding.

### From **How Might We (HMW)**

1. **HMW #3 (Explore the Opposite)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we encourage more people to use TransMilenio despite safety concerns by making it feel like an even more secure option than private vehicles?  
   Answer: By integrating AI-driven features such as real-time crime prevention alerts, predictive safety patterns, and secure transport options, we can build a service that’s perceived as safer than private vehicles. Additionally, offering incentives or rewards for using TransMilenio during peak hours could shift behavior away from private car usage.”**

2. **HMW #4 (Question an Assumption)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we question the assumption that private vehicles are inherently safer than public transport during peak hours?  
   Answer: By analyzing external data on traffic accidents and congestion, we could compare the safety risks of private vehicles versus public transport…”**

3. **HMW #8 (Play Against the Challenge)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we encourage private vehicle owners to choose TransMilenio without the perception of safety issues being a deterrent?  
   Answer: By analyzing how private vehicle owners plan their trips and integrating features like on-demand services, improved security measures, and personalized travel suggestions…”**

4. **HMW #9 (Change a Status Quo)**  
   > **“HMW: How might we shift the perception of TransMilenio from a secondary option to the primary choice for commuting?  
   Answer: By improving real-time crowd management with AI, introducing incentives during peak hours (e.g., discounts or rewards for using TransMilenio), and enhancing safety, we could change how citizens view public transport…”**

## White Hat (Facts and Information):
* TransMilenio operates in high-density areas with higher safety risks, particularly related to incidents like fights and vandalism.
* Public transportation, while widely used (34% of trips), faces concerns about safety, comfort, and overcrowding.
* Approximately 3% of people switch modes due to safety concerns, and private car use is preferred due to perceived safety and comfort.
* Data also shows that several TransMilenio terminals are located near areas with higher rates of incidents, exacerbating the safety concerns.

## Red Hat (Feelings and Emotions):
* Many participants felt frustrated or conflicted about the safety and comfort issues associated with public transport.
* Car users expressed a desire for more control and safety, while public transport users wanted improvements in security and comfort.
* The TransMilenio station manager and drivers felt stressed by the safety concerns, while the police officer and government official were focused on improving security and policy.

## Yellow Hat (Positives and Benefits):
* The possibility of creating a safer, more appealing TransMilenio through AI-driven security measures and real-time crowd management.
* Rewards or incentives for using public transport could attract more riders, reducing dependence on private cars.
* Improved comfort, security, and efficiency could make TransMilenio more competitive against private vehicles.

## Black Hat (Risks and Challenges):
* Perception of safety is hard to change, and the public might not fully trust improvements even with increased security.
* Upgrading infrastructure and integrating advanced technology requires significant investment, time, and resources.
* There is a potential risk that people might still prefer private cars due to comfort, control, and convenience.

## Green Hat (Creativity and Solutions):
* Hybrid transport options, combining public transport with private shuttles, could appeal to car users.
* AI-driven real-time safety updates and VIP sections for vulnerable groups could address comfort and security concerns.
* Incentives, like rewards or discounts for frequent users, and improving stations with smart features could enhance the overall experience.
