## DEBONO HATS PHASE 2

## Point of View 2: 
"The lack of perceived safety in the TransMilenio, especially during peak hours, drives citizens to prefer private vehicles, further contributing to Bogotá's transportation challenges."
<b>Claim:</b> Citizens feel unsafe using TransMilenio, with overcrowding and security concerns deterring use (LINK 4-5 and Claim 5).
<b>Documents:</b> "Ciudad de Bolívar" and "Cartilla Encuesta de Movilidad 2023" discuss how security concerns, particularly during peak hours, contribute to the preference for private vehicles over public transportation, impacting Bogotá's goal of reducing congestion.

## White Hat (Facts and Information):
* TransMilenio faces significant overcrowding, particularly during peak hours.
* Key issues include delays, high crime rates, and an inefficient station layout, especially in high-incident areas.
* The system struggles with poor reliability and inconsistent service schedules.
* Despite these challenges, a significant portion of the population still relies on TransMilenio due to limited alternatives.

## Red Hat (Feelings and Emotions):
* Many expressed frustration with overcrowding and the unreliability of the system, leading to skepticism about whether the system can be improved.
* There is also a sense of hope that with the right investments in infrastructure, technology, and security, the system can be made safer and more efficient.
* Some feel that public transportation can never fully match the comfort and security of private vehicles.
* Others remain hopeful about the potential benefits of these improvements, which could enhance the travel experience and safety.

## Yellow Hat (Positives and Benefits):
* Improving station design could reduce congestion, improve safety, and enhance passenger experience.
* There is potential for positive outcomes from integrating smart technologies like AI for better scheduling, crowd management, and resource optimization.
* Enhanced security and better station infrastructure would boost public confidence, attract more commuters, and reduce reliance on private vehicles.
* Improving public transportation would benefit the environment by reducing traffic congestion.

## Black Hat (Risks and Challenges):
* Road congestion and delays would continue to affect TransMilenio’s efficiency, even with station upgrades.
* Transitioning to smarter, more reliable systems could face resistance, require substantial investment, and take time.
* While improving safety is crucial, certain neighborhoods may still present high levels of risk due to the deep-rooted nature of criminal activities.
* Funding constraints could prevent the necessary enhancements to both infrastructure and security, limiting long-term improvements.

## Green Hat (Creativity and Solutions):
* Potential solutions included integrating bike lanes and pedestrian walkways around stations to facilitate smoother transitions between different transport modes.
* Real-time scheduling systems powered by AI could help optimize bus routes, reduce delays, and improve crowd management.
* Increasing police presence, using community-based security measures, and leveraging volunteer patrols could help improve safety at stations.
* Improving station amenities, such as seating and shaded areas, would enhance comfort and reduce stress for passengers.
