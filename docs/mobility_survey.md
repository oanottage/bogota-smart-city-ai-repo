TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITY BOGOTA


1. Introduction
Bogotá is Colombia’s capital and the core of a larger metropolitan region comprising 20 neighboring municipalities. With a combined 9.27 million residents (aged 5 years and older), the city and its surrounding area confront significant mobility challenges: rapid urban growth, uneven infrastructure coverage, and evolving travel needs shaped by socioeconomic disparities.

The Bogotá Mobility Survey – Region 2023 provides in-depth insights into:

Household demographics (size, income, vehicles owned)
Travel behaviors (modes used, purpose and duration of trips)
User preferences (time valuation, willingness to pay congestion charges)
Network performance (volume-to-capacity ratios, travel speed, congestion)
All data are essential for understanding how people move, informing public policies, and prioritizing investment to achieve safe, equitable, and sustainable mobility.

2. Key Socioeconomic Indicators
Population and Households

Bogotá–Región: 9.27 million people (80% in Bogotá, 20% in surrounding municipalities).
Bogotá: 7.45 million inhabitants; among its 20 localities, Suba, Kennedy, Engativá, Bosa, and Fontibón host over half of the population.
Total Households: 3.67 million region-wide (2.98 million in Bogotá). The average household size in Bogotá is 2.50 members, decreasing from 3.11 in 2019.
Socioeconomic Disparities

Roughly 50% of Bogotá’s households are in strata 1 and 2 (lowest incomes), while higher strata (5–6) account for less than 10%.
These differences strongly influence vehicle ownership and travel choices, with higher strata more likely to own private vehicles and pay for mobility conveniences.
Education and Occupation

Over 55% of residents have completed secondary or higher education; around 25% have jobs in private-sector companies, followed by independent work (≈18%).
3. Vehicle Ownership and Use
Car Ownership Trends

Region-wide, 1.14 million private cars are owned by households.
The cars-per-household ratio dropped from 0.41 in 2019 to 0.31 in 2023, indicating slower growth in car fleets relative to the expansion of households.
Nonetheless, certain corridors experience high levels of car usage during peak hours.
Motorcycles and Bicycles

There are 674,444 motorcycles across Bogotá–Región, with over 80% located in Bogotá.
Bicycle ownership stands at 1.43 million units, mostly conventional. Increasing bicycle use is linked to both post-pandemic shifts and municipal efforts to promote cycling infrastructure.
Alternative Vehicles

The survey highlights 114,664 alternative-energy vehicles (electric, hybrid, or gas) in the region. Half are private cars, indicating a gradual turn toward cleaner technology among higher-income households.
4. Travel Patterns and Daily Trips
Overall Trip Volume

On a typical weekday, 14.62 million trips take place if we exclude short walks under 15 minutes. When including short walks, the count reaches 16.72 million. Bogotá alone generates 83% of these trips.
Modal Split

69.69% of trips in Bogotá–Región (excluding short walks) are by sustainable modes: walking (>15 minutes), public transport, or bicycle. In Bogotá specifically, 62.20% of daily trips are in walking or transit.
Nonetheless, private vehicles (cars and motorcycles) still account for a significant share. The largest single mode in Bogotá is public transport with over 34% of trips, followed by walking at 28%, and autos at around 14%.
Peak-Hour Concentrations

The morning rush (6:15–7:15 a.m.) registers about 1.64 million trips, predominantly originating in southern and western neighborhoods—areas that feed into the city center or north.
During these peak periods, major corridors (e.g., Autopista Norte, Av. Boyacá, Calle 80) see over 6,000 vehicles per hour in at least one direction.
Trip Duration and Cost

The average travel time is 48 minutes across modes, but it rises to 79 minutes for those using public transport. By contrast, private-car and motorcycle trips average around 50 minutes.
The subjective cost of travel time (the monetary value people assign to each minute) is COP $224 for car users, $206 for motorcyclists, and $169 for public-transport riders. Waiting time for buses can reach a penalty of $331 per minute—underscoring the dislike for delays and transfers.
5. Post-Pandemic Changes
Overall Trip Decline

Daily trips declined by 1.4 million (about –8.7%) compared to 2019.
Many former public-transport users switched instead to walking or motorcycles, not necessarily to cars. Remote work and altered schedules also contributed to fewer overall trips.
Shifts in Trip Motives

Work-related trips slightly increased (to 3.22 million), while trips for study, shopping, and personal errands dropped—likely due to online alternatives and new telework/tele-education forms.
Higher Reliance on Two-Wheel Modes

Motorcycle use rose by roughly 100,000 daily trips vs. 2019. Bicycles also gained popularity as short, point-to-point solutions.
6. Reasons for Choosing Private Vehicles Over Public Transport
Despite policy efforts favoring mass transit, a significant share of users (especially in higher-income brackets) continue to drive because of:

Time Valuation and Convenience

Car owners place a high monetary value on each minute, making them reluctant to tolerate waiting times or route transfers typical in public transport.
They also appreciate direct, door-to-door trips and the freedom to depart whenever they choose, plus simpler “trip-chaining” for errands.
Security and Comfort Concerns

The survey shows only 3% of the population changed modes explicitly due to public-security concerns, but public transport is rated 2.0 out of 5.0 on perceived safety, the lowest among modes.
Overcrowding, risk of theft or harassment, and general discomfort spur higher-income travelers to remain with their cars.
Ability to Pay for Exemptions

Over 50% of car owners in strata 5 and 6 prefer paying the “pico y placa solidario” (congestion charge) to keep driving during restricted hours.
Ongoing expenses (fuel, parking, insurance) are more easily absorbed by wealthier households.
Mixed Perception of Transit Service Quality

Reliability is still a challenge: frequent stops, busy peak hours, and potential service gaps. Users who can afford alternatives rank public transport below 2.5/5 for reliability and comfort.
7. Traffic Flows and Network Performance
High Congestion in Peak Hours

During morning and afternoon peaks, corridors such as Av. Ciudad de Cali, Av. Boyacá, Carrera 68, Autopista Norte, and Autopista Sur exceed volume-to-capacity ratios (above 1.0), causing severe slowdowns to 10–20 km/h.
Infrastructure Coverage

Bogotá’s trunk roads plus expansions into neighboring municipalities are mapped (Maps 39–40), but many busy areas still lack robust public-transport coverage or advanced rail solutions, pushing more motorists onto highways.
Bicycle Network

The city has extensive bike lanes—over 600 km—offering an alternative for short and medium-distance travel. Yet usage is still concentrated in certain localities, influenced by safety perceptions and topography.
8. Concluding Observations
The Bogotá Mobility Survey – Region 2023 highlights a complex, rapidly changing mobility landscape, characterized by:

Persistently High Private Vehicle Demand
Despite falling cars-per-household ratios, those who do own cars remain committed to driving—largely because of the perceived time savings, comfort, and personal safety relative to public transport.

Deep Socioeconomic Divides
Higher-income residents can afford private-vehicle costs and are more likely to pay exemptions. Lower-income households adapt by traveling off-peak or switching to motorcycles or walking.

Opportunities for Modal Shift
The post-pandemic era brought an uptick in walking and cycling—partly due to health, cost, or personal preference. Expanding and improving public transport (especially reliability, security, and comfort) could recapture some riders.

Need for Continuous Investment
Overcrowded corridors and limited off-peak service highlight the urgent need to upgrade infrastructure and operational efficiency—ensuring public transport becomes a truly competitive alternative to private cars.

Focus on Equity and Sustainability
With 70% of trips already made in “sustainable modes” (walking, biking, public transit), Bogotá has a strong foundation. However, bridging the quality gap and addressing safety, reliability, and integration remain key to building a fully inclusive, multimodal urban mobility system.
